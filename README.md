Hi, I'm Jon! 👋 In addition to the stuff in the left pane, and below, here's a few of the other things I've made!

- 🕰🎥 [TimeSnapper](https://timesnapper.com) - Records your screen as you use your computer. Saves me surprisingly often in situations where I otherwise would have lost work. I wrote the [Mac version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timesnapper/id1456327684); also for Windows!
- ⚔🛡 [Vigil RPG](https://aggromagnetgames.com/vigil-rpg/) - Classic-style, solo-character turn-based RPG, with modern design sensibilities. Designed especially for the iPhone platform. Named to [TouchArcade's list of the best 10 JRPGs availble on iOS](https://toucharcade.com/2018/01/18/the-best-jrpgs-for-iphone/)!
- 🗓🎗 [Desktop Journey](https://aggromagnetgames.com/desktop-journey/) - Makes your iPhone useful while it's charging at your desk, by displaying current and "next" calendar appointments and reminders, a clock, weather, and more.
- 📎😁 [clipemoji.com](https://clipemoji.com/) - A fast way to find an emoji you want and get it copied to your clipboard, for easy pasting elsewhere.
